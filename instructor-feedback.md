## Exceeds spec

### The code is appropriately commented
My code has descriptive in line comments in a consistent format in each of my scripts. They also each have code titles/headings stating what the script is and what each chunk does. My function (moving_average.R) has a Roxygen skeleton for additional documentation. 

### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
My analysis is separated into three sequential scripts for data cleaning, calculating the rolling average with a sourced function, and plotting. There is little code in the actual Quarto doc.

## Collaboration
In giving peer feedback, I made sure to be detailed in how they met each spec and what they did well, or if it was not yet met give specific suggestions about what changes to make to meet the spec. For example, I stated that the graphs had correct axes and plotted the rolling averages for each site really well and included a legend, but needed one more graph for a missing nutrient and suggested stacking them using either facet wrap or patchwork in an Issue. I also added an .R file for environment installation in my forked copy and they were able to merge my pull request.
